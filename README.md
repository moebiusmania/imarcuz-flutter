> Remake of my first ever iPhone app, now built with Flutter.

My first iPhone app ever was this simple parody random-phrase-shuffler app designed around some weird statements from a friend of mine.

Now I've rebuilt it from scracth, bringing back some old assets I've found in my Dropbox folder and rebuilding it using Google's [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) toolkit. 

This was a simple app back then and it is still so right now... this is basically a customization of the starting template of Flutter projects

## Platform
Right now I'm mainly targeting the [Android](https://www.android.com/) platform since I'm not going to release this into any app store, but just sending the `.apk` build to friends and colleagues.

But since this project is written on top of Flutter, it can eventually be also be build for [iOS](https://www.apple.com/it/ios).
